# ft_printf
In this project we were required to implement our own printf function, yet with a more simplistic functionality. The base implementation needed, at least, to behave in the same way as the original printf handling different data types to be printed. The bonus required to add more advanced features also present in the original function.

## About my implementation
I usually do the bonuses, however due to time constraints I decided not to do this one. Moreover, this project was developed when the Madrid Campus was still using MacOS. Due to some differences with Ubuntu, it no longer works properly and I have no time to 'fix it' so it works on Linux.
